## Project Title
MindMate – AI-Powered Mental Wellness Tracker

## Project Description    
The project I created is **MindMate**, a full-stack web application designed to help users monitor and improve their emotional well-being.  
MindMate allows users to **log their moods**, **write daily journals**, and receive **AI-generated insights** or suggestions based on their emotional trends.  
The app visualizes mood patterns using charts and helps users build mindfulness habits — all while keeping their data private and secure with **Appwrite’s backend services**.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration behind **MindMate** came from observing how mental health is often overlooked in our daily lives.  
Many people struggle to express their emotions or track their mental state consistently.  
I wanted to create a safe, AI-assisted digital space where users can self-reflect, understand their emotions better, and take steps toward a balanced mental life — without needing clinical tools or sharing sensitive data publicly.
