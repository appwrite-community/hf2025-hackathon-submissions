## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

<!--
QuietSpace is a productivity and focus web application designed to help users stay distraction-free, organize tasks, practice mindfulness, and maintain a calm working environment.
Users can create an account, log in securely, manage focus sessions, and track tasks — powered by modern frontend tools and Appwrite backend services.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

<!--
In today's digital age, distractions are everywhere. I built QuietSpace to help individuals — especially students and remote workers — maintain focus, reduce stress, and stay productive.
The app was inspired by my own need to study and work without distractions, building a calm digital workspace for better focus and mental clarity.
