## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

I created a Project name GreenSteps which is an environmental impact tracker designed to help individuals and organizations measure, understand, and reduce their carbon footprint. With interactive dashboards, personalized recommendations, and gamified progress tracking, users are empowered to make sustainable choices and visualize their positive impact on the environment.

- Track daily, weekly, and monthly carbon emissions
- Log activities (transport, energy, consumption)
- Visualize progress with charts and analytics
- Set and achieve personalized sustainability goals
- Get AI-powered eco-friendly suggestions
- Join community challenges and leaderboards

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The inspiration for GreenSteps came from my personal experience witnessing the environmental challenges in my city, from increasing pollution to extreme weather patterns. I realized that while many people want to live more sustainably, they often don't know where to start or how to measure their impact. GreenSteps was created to bridge this gap by making environmental action accessible, measurable, and engaging. By combining gamification with real impact tracking, I wanted to empower individuals to make meaningful changes while seeing the tangible difference they're making for our planet.
