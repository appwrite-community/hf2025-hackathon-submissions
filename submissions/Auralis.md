## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_


The Reason i chose this project is everyone uses excelidraw to teach but something always feels missing! therefore decided to build a space where ideas can breathe in two dimensions how about an platform which can also give u something like an text area and canvas for drawing also. 

It's *it’s where thought meets flow.*
