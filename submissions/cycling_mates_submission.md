Cycling Mates

## Project Description

_What have you built during the hackathon?_

A location-based cycling meetup platform where cyclists can quickly create, discover, and join casual group rides in their area - think "Tinder for cyclists" but focused on forming riding groups rather than dating.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

Many cyclists struggle to find riding partners at their skill level and schedule. Existing platforms like Strava are great for tracking but poor for organizing spontaneous rides. Meetup.com charges fees and has limited cycling-specific features. Most cycling groups rely on WhatsApp or Facebook, making it hard for new cyclists to discover them
