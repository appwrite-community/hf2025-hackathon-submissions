## Anything Else?  
I had an amazing experience building LiveCV during this hackathon! 🎉

This project allowed me to explore Appwrite's Auth, Database, Storage, and Realtime features in depth — integrating them seamlessly into a production-ready, AI-powered resume builder.

I'd love to continue contributing to Appwrite and explore integrating Appwrite Functions for automated resume scoring and AI-driven job recommendations in future versions.
