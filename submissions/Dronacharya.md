## 🧠 Project Description    

Dronacharya is a next-generation **multi-agent AI web app** that empowers startups and product teams to refine, scale, and elevate their products through strategic insights.  

During the hackathon, we built an integrated platform where **multiple specialized AI agents** collaborate to perform high-level product analysis, offer data-driven recommendations, and simplify decision-making.  

Each agent in Dronacharya focuses on a specific domain—such as **product refinement, competitor tracking, market analysis, and investor discovery**—and works together to provide a holistic perspective for founders and teams.  

The system is powered by **Vite**, **React**, and **Tailwind CSS** for speed and responsiveness, while AI intelligence is handled by **Gemini** and **OpenAI** APIs.  
Data handling and authentication are seamlessly managed through **Appwrite**, making the platform scalable and secure.  

In short, **Dronacharya acts as your AI mentor**, offering timeless strategic wisdom reimagined for the modern digital world.

## 💡 Inspiration behind the Project  

The inspiration behind **Dronacharya** came from the challenges faced by modern founders and product teams who often rely on multiple disconnected tools for analytics, strategy, and scaling.  

We wanted to create a unified AI-powered platform that could act as a **digital mentor**—just like the legendary teacher **Dronacharya**, who guided warriors with wisdom and precision.  

In today’s fast-paced startup ecosystem, founders need not just data, but **strategic intelligence**—insights that help them understand the “why” behind every product decision. That’s where our idea was born.  

By combining the collective intelligence of multiple AI agents, each specializing in strategy, product refinement, and investor discovery, **Dronacharya** helps startups make smarter, faster, and more confident decisions—bringing ancient strategic thinking into the modern AI era.
