## Project Title
StreamX - AI Powered Real-time Polling Platform

## Project Description    
StreamX is a AI Powered real-time polling and survey platform built with Next.js 15, Appwrite Cloud, and modern UI components. Create engaging polls in seconds, share with QR codes, and watch responses flow in live.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

So basically, I was attending this online workshop last month and the instructor was using some old looking polling tool. Students couldn't submit their responses properly and the whole session got some delayes. That's when I thought - why not build something better?

I've always been frustrated with how complicated most polling platforms are. Like, you need to download apps, create accounts, and it's just too much hassle for something that should be simple. I wanted to create something where anyone can just scan a QR code and start answering questions immediately - no friction, no barriers.

Also, as a student myself, I know how useful real-time polling can be in classrooms, events, and even casual hangouts. The idea of seeing responses flow in live with cool charts and animations really excited me, so I decided to give it a shot!

## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project_

For the frontend, I went with **Next.js 15** (the latest version!) with **TypeScript**. Used **Tailwind CSS** for styling.

For the backend, I relied completely on **Appwrite Cloud** - it's literally a game changer! I used their Auth for user management, Databases for storing polls and responses, Storage for any media files, and the coolest part - **Realtime** for live updates when people submit responses.

For the UI components, I used **shadcn/ui** which gives beautiful, accessible components out of the box. Added **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and **Recharts** for those live data visualizations.

The whole project is deployed on **Appwrite Sites** for the frontend, and all the backend stuff runs on Appwrite Cloud. Used **Bun** as the package manager because it's crazy fast compared to npm!
