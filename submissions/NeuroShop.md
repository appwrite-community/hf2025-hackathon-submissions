## Project Title
NeuroShop


## Project Description    
NeuroShop is a smart price comparison engine that takes a product URL from one of the e-commerce site, scrapes relevant product listings from multiple e-commerce platforms, matches similar items using fuzzy logic, and presents a clean, unified view of prices and details — helping users make faster, smarter buying decisions.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
The idea for NeuroShop was born out of the frustration of manually comparing the same product across multiple e-commerce platforms like Flipkart and Amazon. Constantly switching tabs, checking specs, and hunting for the best deal felt tedious and inefficient. This sparked the vision for a smarter solution — a tool that could automate the comparison process, intelligently match similar listings, and present everything in one unified view. With a strong foundation in scraping, fuzzy matching, and UI/UX design, I set out to build a system that combines Puppeteer for real-time data extraction, Fuse.js for intelligent matching, and a seamless React + Appwrite interface. NeuroShop aims to feel like a personal shopping assistant — fast, intuitive, and reliable — while showcasing robust backend/frontend integration and resilient scraping logic.
