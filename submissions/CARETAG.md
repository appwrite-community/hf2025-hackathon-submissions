## Project Title

Caretag

## Project Description

A web application that uses image recognition to identify and explain clothing care symbols from photos.

## Inspiration behind the Project

Clothing care labels are confusing. They're covered in cryptic symbols that most people don't understand. This leads to:

- Googling symbols every time you buy new clothes
- Accidentally ruining garments with wrong care
- Wasting time trying to decipher washing instructions

## Tech Stack

- **React 19** - UI library
- **Material UI 7** - Component library
- **Vite** - Build tool and dev server
- **React Router** - Client-side routing
- **TanStack Query** - Data fetching and caching
