## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

I built an Appwrite integration plugin for n8n, allowing users to connect and automate workflows between Appwrite and the n8n automation platform.

With this plugin, users can:

List, create, update, and retrieve documents from Appwrite collections

Use Appwrite as part of broader automated workflows in n8n

Connect Appwrite to dozens of other services supported by n8n without writing custom scripts

This integration makes it easier for developers and no-code users to harness Appwrite’s backend capabilities within visual workflows.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

I recently discovered n8n, and after hearing about it for a while, I finally gave it a try — and instantly fell in love with the platform. However, I noticed that n8n didn’t have native support for Appwrite, which is an amazing backend-as-a-service.

So, I decided to build an Appwrite integration for n8n. This way, anyone — even those without coding experience — can start using Appwrite within their automated workflows. By combining the power of n8n’s no-code/low-code automation with Appwrite’s backend services, this integration makes building full-stack apps more accessible than ever.
