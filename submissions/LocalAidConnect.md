# Hackathon Submission: LocalAid Connect

## GitHub handle

## Project Title
LocalAid Connect

## Project Description    
LocalAid Connect is a real-time community emergency response platform that connects local helpers with those in need during crises. The platform enables immediate matching between people who need assistance and those who can provide help during emergencies, natural disasters, or community crises.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
During natural disasters and local emergencies, there's often confusion and disconnect between people who need help and those who can provide it. While social media platforms exist, critical information gets lost in the noise. LocalAid Connect provides a focused, verified, and organized way to coordinate community emergency response.
