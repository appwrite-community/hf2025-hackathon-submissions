## Project Title
8ion

## Project Description
8ion is an intelligent workflow builder for N8N. It transforms simple, natural language prompts into complex, N8N-compatible JSON workflows. Instead of manually building automation workflows by dragging and dropping nodes, users can simply describe what they want to achieve (e.g., "When I get a new email, save the attachment to my cloud storage and notify me on Slack"), and 8ion will generate the necessary JSON configuration instantly. This allows both new and experienced users to create powerful automations faster and more intuitively.

## Inspiration behind the Project
The inspiration for 8ion came from the desire to make powerful automation tools like N8N more accessible. While N8N is incredibly capable, building complex workflows can still be a steep learning curve. I wanted to leverage the recent advancements in AI to abstract away that complexity. The goal is to allow users to focus on the "what" (their desired outcome) rather than the "how" (the specific nodes and configurations), effectively turning ideas into automated workflows in seconds.

## Tech Stack
The project is built as a modern web application. The front-end will be a simple UI built with a modern JavaScript framework. The entire backend, including the core business logic, user management, and data storage, is powered by Appwrite. The core workflow generation is handled by a serverless function that interfaces with an AI model like Gemini.
