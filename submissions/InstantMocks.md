InstantMocks

## Project Description

#### InstantMocks allows the developers to create ephemeral dynamic mock APIs in under a minute. <br/> The developers around the globe usually face the problem of having a real test data while developing the frontend and may consider assumptions which eventually leads to the introduction of unexpected bugs in production. This not only leads to the loss of time but also reduces the efficiency of the developers. <br/> Therefore, below are the features InstantMocks provide to enhance the developers' experience:

- 🔓 No authentication required. This helps the developers to quickly setup the mock APIs for their projects.
- ⚡ The developers could generate APIs that serve both hardcoded and dynamic responses using Gemini AI.
- 🔍 The developers could use Gemini AI to generate schema for the APIs which are based on real API response.
- 💫 Out of the box support for the different HTTP methods.
- 🔄 Easily share the created mock APIs with anyone instantly.
- ⏳ The APIs are ephemeral by nature with a maximum 1 hour validity.

## Inspiration behind the Project

#### The inspiration of this project stems from my own problem. During my time of learning the frontend I have always struggled to find APIs that I could integrated quickly and easily while making sure less of migration work to real APIs. After talking to my juniors and reading Reddit comments, I knew there needs to exist a tool like this. <br/> Therefore, I thought what better project than creating a tool for the developers that help them setup mock APIs instantly, without any hassle, and that too a tool that is open source during the Hacktoberfest. <br/> I hoped this tool existed when I was getting started out and thanks to the hackathon that pushed me to create a tool for the new generation of developers.

> This project is my little way to return back to the open source community and next generation of developers ❤️
