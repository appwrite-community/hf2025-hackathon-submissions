## Project Title  
ChatAI — React + Redux AI Chat Interface

## Project Description    
ChatAI is a conversational AI assistant web application built using React for the frontend and Redux for client‑side state and storage. Users can type messages, which are sent to an AI model (for example, via the OpenAI API), and responses come back and are displayed. Redux manages chat history, user input state, loading/UI status, and synchronizes state across components.

This architecture allows for extensibility: future features like persisting chat history, user profiles, saving conversations, or multi‑device sessions can plug into the Redux store and backend logic easily.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
Conversational AI is rapidly becoming a key interface paradigm, and I wanted to build an open, modular chat system. React + Redux gives me a clean separation of UI and state logic, and it’s flexible enough for future scaling (e.g. adding authentication, database storage, multiple chat models, etc.). I aimed to create a robust starter framework others can build on.

## Tech Stack    
The technologies I used include:

- **Frontend**: React 
- **State Management / Storage**: Redux  
- **Backend / API**: Node.js (Express), OpenAI API   
- **Deployment**:  Vercel
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
