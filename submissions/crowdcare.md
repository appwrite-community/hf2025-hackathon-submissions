## Project Title
CrowdCare

## Project Description    
CrowdCare is a community-driven platform where citizens can report and track local civic issues such as potholes, garbage, broken streetlights, and water supply problems. Authorities can update the status of reported issues, and the community can engage through comments and upvotes. Built using **React** for frontend and **Appwrite** for backend services including authentication, database, storage, and realtime updates.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The reason I chose this idea was to create a practical platform that allows citizens to actively participate in improving their local communities. I wanted to bridge the gap between citizens and authorities by making issue reporting and tracking simple, transparent, and interactive.

## Tech Stack    
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Vite  
- Backend: Appwrite (Auth, Database, Storage, Realtime)
