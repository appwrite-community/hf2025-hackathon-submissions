## Project Title

The Cube Shop - Interactive Shopping Store Management Game

## Project Description    

I built an interactive browser-based shop management game where players run their own store.
The game features inventory management, dynamic customer interactions with AI-driven shopping behavior, a memory-based billing challenge, and a strategic profit upgrade system with real-time timers.
Players must balance pricing strategies, serve time-sensitive customers, and upgrade their profit margins to maximize earnings.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

I wanted to create a game that combines strategy with memory skills while learning basic business concepts like pricing, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.
The inspiration came from classic shop management games, but with a modern twist - using intelligent algorithms for customer behavior and adding a memory challenge element to make gameplay more engaging and skill-based rather than just click-based automation.
