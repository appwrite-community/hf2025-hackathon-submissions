## Project Description

_What have you built during the hackathon?_

### Virtual Science Lab

It is an educational web application that democratizes science education by providing a safe, accessible, and cost-free platform for conducting virtual experiments. Whether you're a student, teacher, or curious learner, this platform enables hands-on exploration of chemistry and physics concepts without the need for physical equipment.

## Inspiration behind the Project

_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

Growing up, I was fascinated by science but often frustrated by limited access to laboratory equipment and the inability to safely experiment with interesting (but dangerous) chemical reactions. This experience stayed with me, and I realized that countless students worldwide face the same barriers—or worse. Many schools lack basic lab facilities, chemicals are expensive, and safety concerns restrict what students can actually explore hands-on.

I chose to build Virtual Science Lab because I wanted to solve this problem using technology. The idea was simple: create a completely free, web-based platform where anyone—regardless of location or resources—could conduct real science experiments safely. By combining 3D graphics (Three.js), realistic physics simulations, and AI assistance (powered by OpenRouter), I could offer an experience that goes beyond what traditional labs provide: unlimited materials, zero risk, instant expert guidance, and the freedom to make mistakes and learn from them.

What made this project particularly exciting was integrating Appwrite for user authentication and cloud storage, allowing students to save their experiments and build a personalized learning journey over time. This isn't just about replicating a physical lab—it's about reimagining science education for the digital age, making it accessible, interactive, and intelligent for everyone with an internet connection.
