## Project Description    
During the hackathon, I built **DevConnect**, a full-stack developer community platform that allows users to connect, share posts, react to discussions, and collaborate in real time.  

The platform includes user authentication, post creation, comments, and reactions — all powered by **React**, **Vite**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Appwrite** for backend services.  

DevConnect aims to create an interactive and engaging space for developers to learn, share, and grow together.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration behind **DevConnect** came from observing how beginners often struggle when they start their programming journey. Many new developers face difficulties finding guidance, sharing progress, or connecting with like-minded learners.  

I wanted to build a platform that bridges this gap — a place where beginners and experienced developers can collaborate, share ideas, and support each other. **DevConnect** was created to make learning and growing as a developer more interactive, supportive, and community-driven.

## Tech Stack    
This project was built using a modern full-stack approach with the following technologies:  

- **Frontend:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS  
- **Backend & Database:** Appwrite (for authentication, database, and storage)  
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Vercel (for frontend deployment)  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

These tools were chosen for their simplicity, scalability, and developer-friendly integration — enabling fast development and smooth deployment.
