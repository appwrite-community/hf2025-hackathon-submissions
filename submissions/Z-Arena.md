## Project Title

Z-Arena

## Project Description    

Z-Arena is a next-generation **coding challenge platform** for developers to compete based on ***practical, real-world development skills***, not just algorithms.

It features **50+ challenges** tailored to practical use cases, such as building a complete library from scratch, designing an LRU-cache, or creating a custom web scraper.

The platform includes a **"War" mode**: an intense, ***real-time 1v1 duel*** where two developers race to solve 5 random questions in 5 minutes, complete with a full **ELO rating system**.

The standout feature is the ***custom-built "Z--" programming language*** and its compiler, **created entirely from scratch**, which is fully integrated for solving challenges.

**Appwrite is the backend powerhouse**, seamlessly managing user authentication, storing all challenge/submission/user data in **Appwrite Databases**, and powering the real-time battles and leaderboards with **Appwrite Realtime**. **Appwrite Functions** are also used for backend logic like database seeding.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

As a competitive programmer, I've spent hundreds of hours on platforms like Codeforces and LeetCode. While I loved the algorithmic challenges, I felt something was missing: a place to compete on ***practical development skills***. Where could developers battle-test their ability to build real-world components, not just solve abstract puzzles?

This gap inspired me to create Z-Arena. I designed a platform from the ground up to challenge developers with **50+ practical problems**.

To push the project to an event-winning level, I gave myself two additional challenges:

1.  **Create my own programming language, "Z--",** and its compiler **entirely from scratch**, and integrate it as a first-class citizen for solving problems.

2.  Build a high-stakes, ***real-time 1v1 "War" mode*** with an ELO rating system, where opponents race against the clock.

This entire, original-concept project was only feasible because **Appwrite handled all the backend complexity (Auth, Realtime DBs, Functions)**, allowing me to focus on building the unique, technically-challenging features that make Z-Arena special.
