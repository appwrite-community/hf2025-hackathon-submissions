WebSecurity-Scanner


## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_


During the hackathon I built a Web Security Scannera tool that helps identify vulnerabilities in websites.
It scans for issues like SQL injection, XSS, and other common security flaws, giving developers actionable insights to make their websites safer.
The project automates security testing making it faster and easier to detect potential risks.


## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_


The reason I chose this project was that web security is becoming increasingly important yet many developers overlook it during development.
I wanted to create a tool that makes it easier to identify vulnerabilities quickly, helping websites stay secure and protecting user data.
The idea came from seeing how common attacks like SQL injection and XSS still affect many sites, and I wanted to build something practical that solves this real-world problem.


## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project_


The technologies I used include Python for backend development, along with libraries for web scanning and security testing.
The frontend was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a user-friendly interface. I also used GitHub for version control and deployment, ensuring the project is organized, maintainable, and easy to test.
