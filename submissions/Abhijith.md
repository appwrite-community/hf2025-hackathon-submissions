## Project Title
CodeCapture

## Project Description    
CodeCapture is a developer-focused application that enables users to capture, organize, and manage code snippets efficiently. The platform provides syntax highlighting, categorization, tagging, and a powerful search functionality to help developers build their personal library of reusable code. With CodeCapture, developers can quickly save solutions, annotate them with notes, and retrieve them whenever needed, significantly improving productivity and code reusability across projects.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
As a developer, I constantly encountered the frustration of searching through old projects, Stack Overflow history, or scattered notes to find code snippets I had written before. I realized this was a universal pain point - we solve problems daily, but lack an organized system to preserve and retrieve these solutions. CodeCapture was inspired by the need for a centralized, searchable code snippet manager that acts as a developer's personal knowledge base. The goal was to create a tool that not only stores code but makes it easily discoverable and shareable, ultimately saving developers valuable time and helping them learn from their past work.
