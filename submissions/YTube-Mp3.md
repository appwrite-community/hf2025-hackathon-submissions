## Project Title

YTube-Mp3

## Project Description    

A Webpage that converts YouTube videos to high-quality MP3 audio files. Users can submit a YouTube URL and receive a downloadable MP3 file stored in cloud storage with metadata tracking in a database.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

The motivation for building this project was to create a practical, scalable solution for audio extraction from YouTube videos. Many users want to listen to music, podcasts, or audiobooks offline without downloading entire video files. This project demonstrates how to build an automated conversion pipeline using serverless architecture, making it cost-effective and easy to deploy without managing servers.
