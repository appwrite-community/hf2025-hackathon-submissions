## Project Title
AI Wallet

## Project Description    
AI Wallet is an intelligent crypto wallet built on the Stacks blockchain that allows users to manage Bitcoin and Stacks assets through natural language commands rather than manual clicks. Powered by AI agents, the wallet can understand user prompts, execute blockchain transactions, automate investments, and integrate with DeFi protocols, all while ensuring security and notifications.

Key features include:

- **Natural Language Transactions:** Parse commands like “Transfer 0.01 BTC to Alice” and execute them seamlessly.
- **Automated Investments:** Execute instructions such as “Invest 50% of my balance into top 3 rising stocks.”
- **DeFi Integrations:** Stake, provide liquidity, and earn yield on Stacks protocols.
- **Security & Notifications:** Enforce safety rules and alert users about risky actions.
- **Extensible AI Agents:** Future support for NFTs, DAO voting, and more.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
I was inspired by the complexity of existing crypto wallets and the steep learning curve for new users. Managing blockchain assets often involves multiple platforms, manual confirmations, and technical knowledge. By combining AI agents with blockchain, I wanted to create a wallet that makes cryptocurrency management intuitive, secure, and accessible for everyone. The goal is to explore the future of AI x Bitcoin L2, making blockchain interactions simpler, smarter, and safer.
