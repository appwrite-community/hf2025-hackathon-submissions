## Project Description

ChatAI is an intelligent AI-powered chatbot designed to engage users in natural, meaningful conversations. It leverages modern AI models to understand user queries and provide helpful responses, assisting with various tasks and information needs.

## Inspiration behind the Project

I created ChatAI to make information and assistance more accessible and interactive. I was inspired by the increasing role of AI in everyday applications and wanted to build a chatbot that feels human-like while being helpful, making it easier for users to get answers without searching through multiple sources.


## Tech Stack

The project is built using React for the frontend UI, Redux for state management, and Socket.IO for real-time communication. It integrates with the OpenAI API to provide AI-powered chatbot responses.
