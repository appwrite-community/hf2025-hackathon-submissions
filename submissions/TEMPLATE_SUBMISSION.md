## Project Title

QIExplorer

## Project Description    


QIExplorer is a web dashboard that acts as a Decentralized AI Agent for financial risk and arbitrage in the cryptocurrency market. It leverages the powerful IBM Granite time-series model from Hugging Face to provide users with a suite of tools, including AI-powered price forecasting, real-time risk analysis with confidence scores, and instant arbitrage opportunity detection. The goal is to simplify complex market analysis and empower traders to make smarter, data-driven decisions.


## Inspiration behind the Project  


The inspiration for QIExplorer comes from the inherent complexity and volatility of the cryptocurrency market. For many traders, identifying genuine opportunities while managing risk is a constant challenge. I wanted to build a tool that could bring the power of state-of-the-art open-source AI models to the everyday crypto trader.

By integrating a specific, high-performance model like IBM's Granite from the Hugging Face ecosystem, the project aims to democratize access to sophisticated financial insights. The name "Quantum Intelligence" reflects the idea of using advanced AI to process vast amounts of market data, uncovering hidden patterns and providing users with a predictive edge.
