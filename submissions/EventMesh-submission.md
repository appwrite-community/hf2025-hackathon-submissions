EventMesh: Visual Event Routing Platform

## Project Description

EventMesh is a next-generation visual event routing platform that enables users to build complex webhook workflows using drag-and-drop simplicity, AI-powered transformations, and real-time processing. The platform is designed for developer teams, QA engineers, and SaaS vendors who need reliable, testable, and observable event-driven integrations.

## Inspiration behind the Project

I built EventMesh because working with webhooks and event-driven systems is usually a headache. It's hard to see what's happening, things break easily, and fixing problems takes too long. We wanted to make it simple for anyone to create, test, and manage these workflows visually—no more guessing or endless debugging. With EventMesh, you just drag, drop, and connect the pieces, see every step, and quickly fix issues. Our goal is to help teams build reliable event systems without all the stress.
