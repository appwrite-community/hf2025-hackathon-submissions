## Project Title
VirtuLab - Virtual Science & Engineering Lab

## Project Description    
VirtuLab is a comprehensive browser-based Virtual Science & Engineering Lab that transforms how students learn and interact with physics, electrical engineering and astronomy concepts.The platform features a 3D Motion & Optics Lab where students can simulate pendulums,springs, lenses and explore Newton's laws through interactive experiments with real-time physics calculations.The 2D Circuit Builder allows students to drag and drop electrical components,draw precise wire connections and watch their circuits come to life with realistic electrical simulations. The Astronomy Lab takes students on a journey through space,letting them explore celestial mechanics and space phenomena through immersive 3D visualizations.The entire platform is secured with an authentication system that provides personalized learning experiences, while real-time measurement tools enable students to collect and analyze data just like in a real laboratory setting.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
Many children around the world lack access to proper science and engineering laboratories and hands-on learning experiences that make STEM concepts tangible and exciting.The cost of electrical equipment,physics apparatus and laboratory instruments is prohibitively expensive for most families and even many schools,making it impossible for children to afford oscilloscopes,multimeters,circuit components,telescopes and other essential learning tools.Growing up, I witnessed firsthand how students struggled to understand abstract physics,electrical engineering, and astronomy concepts without the ability to experiment and visualize these phenomena,often because the necessary equipment was simply too costly to obtain.The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted this gap when schools moved online,leaving students without access to physical labs and expensive scientific instruments.This inspired me to create VirtuLab, a virtual science & engineering laboratory that could bring the wonder of scientific experimentation across multiple domains to any student with an internet connection,eliminating the financial barriers that prevent children from exploring science and engineering, regardless of their geographical location or economic circumstances.
