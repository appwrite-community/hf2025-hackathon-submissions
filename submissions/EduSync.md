## Inspiration behind the Project  
As online education grows, existing tools often feel fragmented — requiring separate apps for quizzes, video, notes, and grading.
EduSync was inspired by the need for a unified, intelligent classroom experience where teachers and students can collaborate seamlessly in one modern platform.
The motivation was to make learning interactive, AI-driven, and human-centered, reducing the digital fatigue of switching between tools.
