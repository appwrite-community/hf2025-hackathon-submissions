## Project Description    
_What have you built during the hackathon?_

I have built a study group platform with useful features for many people around the world. This includes Short notes, Flashcards, and Quizzes. This is quite of a unique platform as there isnt many large scaled projects like these. The unique whiteboard inspired from Infinite Craft Also gives a clean look to the project. The chat feature has proved quite helpful as it helps in improving communication skills. The export to pdf feature is also useful to refer to after the group study. 

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_

The reason I chose this project was as a student it is easy for me and most probably a lot others to just refer some small key points and remember them easily. This website really proves helpful for group study by using small notes, flashcards and even fun quizzes. The chat feature helps improve communication with people too. This alone is a strong point. This project is helpful to majority of people yet no large scaled projects are built. 



## Tech Stack    
_How have you built this project? Mention the technologies/methods/platforms you used to build your project_

The technologies I used were ChatGPT to draft the clear overview of the project.
And a bit of help from claude along the way. I used Appwrite's Database to store data and 
it helped really a lot also considering it was very easy to use.
