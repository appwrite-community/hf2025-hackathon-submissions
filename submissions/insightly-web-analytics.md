## Deployed Site URL
Appwrite: https://insightly.appwrite.network
Vercel: https://insightly-ochre.vercel.app

Yes I have deployed on vercel as well because somehow my projects deployment isn't working on appwrite, for [reference](https://discord.com/channels/564160730845151244/1433500303768027136).
Maybe because of I am using Tanstack :(
