## Project Title
Lets Talk CDC – Change Feed Playground

## Project Description
A lightweight interactive simulator that demonstrates how Change Data Capture (CDC) works. 
Users can insert, update, or delete rows in a mock database table and instantly see the 
corresponding change events in real time. 

This mini-project is designed as a teaching tool that will later be embedded into the 
LetsTalkCDC learning site.

## Inspiration behind the Project
CDC is often hard to grasp because it’s invisible until you see raw change events. 
This project gives learners a safe “playground” to experiment and see the relationship 
between database operations and captured change streams.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Vanilla JS (or React if time permits)
- Visualization: simple table + event feed display
