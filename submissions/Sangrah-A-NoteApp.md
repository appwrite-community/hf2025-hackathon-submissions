Sangrah-A-NoteApp

## Project Description

Sangrah-A-NoteApp is a modern, feature-rich note-taking application built with React and Appwrite. It provides users with a seamless experience for creating, organizing, and managing their notes with a clean and intuitive interface. The application leverages Appwrite's backend services for authentication, database management, and storage, making it a robust and scalable solution for personal note management.

## Inspiration behind the Project

The inspiration behind Sangrah-A-NoteApp came from the need for a simple yet powerful note-taking application that combines modern web technologies with reliable backend services. The name "Sangrah" means "collection" in Hindi, reflecting the app's purpose of collecting and organizing thoughts and ideas. This project was created to demonstrate the seamless integration of React with Appwrite's powerful backend services during the Hacktoberfest 2025 hackathon.
